### What is Meta?

A source for what's new on the web--customized for you. We want to democratize the traditional model by giving editorial control to the people who use the site, not those who run it. All of the content on Meta is from users who are rewarded for good submissions (and punished for bad ones) by their peers. You decide what appears on your front page and simultaneously, which submissions rise to fame or fall into obscurity.

### What can I submit?

Anything. Well, almost anything. We'd like Meta to be the source for everything that's new on the web: if it's linkable, it's submitable. There is a caveat here, we presently only allow "work-safe" material, which means no adult content.

### How is popularity determined?

Each time you promote  a submission, it boosts it closer to the front page. Conversely, demoting  an item pushes it further down into oblivion.

### How are "Metators" ranked?

When a particular item is promoted or demoted, the Metator who posted it is either rewarded or punished--a system of editorial karma. In the same way that popular submissions are voted to the top, the individuals who post them get increases in karma. Each "Metator" has an equal vote in rating submissions, regardless of his/her karma. Although democracy isn’t perfect, this experiment should supply the public with the information they demand while also rewarding those who provide it.

### How do I accumulate karma?

The exact formula is our little secret, but the easiest (and most effective) way is by making good submissions: items that other people want to read and will subsequently become popular. The Meta users who best understand what people want to be reading about will be rewarded the best.

### Why should I try to accumulate karma?

This is the sort of personal question we try not to answer in a FAQ. It may be worth getting at least a cursory understanding of the concept, but Meta makes no guarantees about achieving Nirvana.

Our editorial karma works a bit differently. It is a way for you to be ranked among your peers in order to reap the bragging rights associated with such status.

### Can anyone submit?

Yes, if you are registered. Submitting is highly encouraged because the system is working at its best when people are contributing to it. By making contributions deemed valuable by your peers, your karma increases, which boosts your rank.

### Who made Meta?

In one sense, if you've participated--you have. But that was probably not the answer you were looking for. This site is brought to you by Tyler Wolfe, a West Hills High School student. You can find him within the Meta community, often publishing posts about the development of Meta.
